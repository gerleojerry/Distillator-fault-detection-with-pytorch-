**Problem Statement:** To detec fault in distallator
This simulated dataset was generated by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory(PNNL) adaptive control 
team using their large office building model. The building model is developed using co-simulation 
framework - building envelope model (using EnergyPlus) and building HVAC system model (using 
Dymola)

This is a classification problem using ANN with pytorch.
